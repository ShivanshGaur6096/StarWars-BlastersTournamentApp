A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…
All the mighty heroes take a break from the long war and are enjoying an off-season. Jabba the Hutt, one of the galaxy's most powerful gangsters had in the meantime organised a Blasters duel for the galaxy's greatest.

The rules of the tournament were simple:
* Each of the players has a match with each other in a round-robin fashion.
* The players need to shoot on a target with their blasters and are awarded a score out of 100 based on that.
* At the end of the match, the scores of both the players are compared to identify the winner
* The player with a higher score (winner) is awarded 3 points
* The player with a lower score (loser) is awarded 0 points
* In case of a draw/tie (scores level), both the players are awarded 1 point each

The tournament was a huge hit and Darth Vader emerged as the ultimate winner. He will be awarded the trophy on Star Wars Day (4th of May), but there are a lot of rumours going around that Vader has used Dark Forces on Jabba the Hutt and has declared himself the winner.

Now,  The Republic has chosen you to curate all the results of the tournament into an app that can be used by all and put an end to the dark forces rumor. You have got only 120 minutes to create this app.

Expectation: 
1. The UI should be as shown in the illustrations. A lot of polishing of the UI is NOT needed.
2. The code should be complete and correct.
3. Code should be clean, readable, modular, extensible
4. The proper naming convention of the language used should be followed

Extensions (attempt only if time permits):
1. Build a UI that can sort the points table by both ascending and descending order.

All the data needed to create the app has to be fetched from the below provided APIs through a network call.
